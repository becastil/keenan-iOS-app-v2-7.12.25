## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Sydney Health Clone seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report

Email us at: security@sydneyhealth-demo.com (Note: This is a demo project email)

Please include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity (see below)

### Severity Levels & Response Times

| Severity | Description | Resolution Time |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Critical | Data breach, authentication bypass, RCE | 24-48 hours |
| High | Privilege escalation, data exposure | 5 business days |
| Medium | Limited data exposure, DoS | 10 business days |
| Low | Minor issues with minimal impact | 30 days |

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables and .env files
2. **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
3. **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper authentication**: Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
5. **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use AES-256 for data at rest
6. **Follow OWASP guidelines**: Reference OWASP Top 10

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update all packages
2. **Use strong passwords**: Implement password policies
3. **Enable 2FA**: When available
4. **Monitor logs**: Check for suspicious activities
5. **Regular backups**: Maintain secure backups

## Security Features

### Currently Implemented

- JWT-based authentication
- HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (planned)
- Audit logging

### Planned Enhancements

- Field-level encryption for PHI/PII
- Biometric authentication (mobile)
- Certificate pinning (mobile)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Intrusion detection system

## HIPAA Compliance Note

This is a demonstration project. For production healthcare applications:

1. Implement full encryption at rest
2. Add automatic session timeout
3. Implement access controls per HIPAA requirements
4. Maintain audit logs for 6 years
5. Implement Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)
6. Regular security risk assessments

## Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Current security-critical dependencies:

- JWT library: Moving from `dgrijalva/jwt-go` to `golang-jwt/jwt` v4+
- Database driver: Using parameterized queries
- TLS: Minimum version 1.2

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] Database credentials encrypted
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificates
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Logging configured (without sensitive data)
- [ ] Backup procedures in place
- [ ] Incident response plan documented
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
