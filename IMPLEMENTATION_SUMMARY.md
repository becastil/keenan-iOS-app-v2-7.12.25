### 2. API Design (gRPC) ✅
- Defined protocol buffers for all services
- Member, Benefits, Claims, Provider, and Messaging services
- Shared common data models
- Build script for code generation

### 3. Backend Microservices (Go) ✅
- API Gateway with authentication and routing
- 5 microservices: Member, Benefits, Claims, Provider, Messaging
- Mock data generation for all services
- Shared utilities for logging, configuration, and database

### 4. Web Application (Fusion.js) ✅

- Dashboard with coverage summary and recent claims
- Benefits page with tabbed interface
- Login with JWT authentication
- Responsive design with Uber's styling

### 5. iOS Application (Swift + RIBs) ✅
- RIBs architecture implementation

- Authentication service with Keychain storage
- Models matching gRPC definitions
- CocoaPods configuration

### 6. Android Application (Kotlin + RIBs) ✅
- RIBs architecture for Android
- Root activity and navigation structure
- Secure credential storage
- Material 3 design system
- Gradle build configuration

### 7. Database Schema (MySQL/PostgreSQL) ✅
- Complete schema for all entities
- Members, benefits, claims, providers, messages
- Proper indexes and foreign keys
- Audit logging support

### 8. Kafka Configuration ✅
- Docker Compose setup for Kafka cluster
- Topic definitions for all event types
- Producer/Consumer implementations in Go
- Real-time event streaming support

### 9. CI/CD Pipeline (Spinnaker) ✅
- Complete pipeline configuration
- Multi-stage deployment (dev, staging, prod)
- Automated testing and security scanning
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Jenkins integration

### 10. Observability Stack ✅
- M3DB for time-series metrics
- Prometheus for metric collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- AlertManager with routing rules
- Comprehensive alert definitions

### 11. Technical Documentation ✅
- Architecture overview with diagrams
- Complete API documentation
- Development setup guide
- Deployment procedures
- Component-specific READMEs

## Key Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin
- **Frameworks**: Fusion.js, RIBs (iOS/Android), gRPC
- **Databases**: MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: Spinnaker, Jenkins
- **Monitoring**: M3, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger

## Mock Data Features

- Member profiles with dependents
- Comprehensive benefit information
- Claims history with various statuses
